Hi! I'm **NÉ™riman** and now you are in my personal website.

I am a student living in [Baku, Azerbaijan]. In my free time, I do volunteer work such as editing Wikipedia, translation and coding.

I am mainly active on the Azerbaijani Wikipedia, my main work is writing and editing articles on topics that interest me (technology, software, and history). In addition, I also do technical work. As an interface admin, I update templates, scripts, and modules. And, as an administrator, I also perform various administrative tasks.

I started coding around 2019. I was inspired by seeing bots being created on the Discord, which I actively use. You can [click here] for the source code of my bot, which I consider to be my biggest project on Discord so far. The main functionality of the bot was to subscribe to any public profile on Twitter and receive notifications on Discord when that profile posted a new tweet. Unfortunately, after Elon Musk bought Twitter, [Twitter stopped offering free API access], and I had to stop the project.

As a volunteer translator, I have over 20,000 translations on [translatewiki], [Crowdin], and [Transifex]. I have translations in popular projects such as [MediaWiki], Wikipedia's Android, KaiOS, iOS [mobile apps], [Creative Commons licenses], Gartic.io, and Mastodon.

I haven't started writing blog posts, but I will start soon.
